# Adeptar
A small .NET file extension aimed to be fast and easy to use, aimed for modding purposes, with manual work in mind.

TO DO:
- Code optimization.
- More features.

First some benchmarks, both serialization and deserialization.
Benchmakrs are compared to NewtonSoft.Json library

An example:

```cs
public class ComponentClass
{  
	public int ItemType;
	public int Id;
	public string Name;
	public int DisplayCategory;
	public int Availability;
	public int ComponentStatsId;
	public int Faction;
	public int Level;
	public string Icon;
	public string Color;
	public string Layout;
	public string CellType;
	public int WeaponId;
	public int AmmunitionId { get; set; }
	public string WeaponSlotType;
	public int[] PossibleModifications;
	public Dictionary<int, int> dict;
}
```

Is serialized as:

```cs
{
        AmmunitionId: 1002,
        Availability: 4,
        CellType: "M",
        Color: "#23444",
        ComponentStatsId: 999,
        dict: [
                1:222,
                2:333
        ],
        DisplayCategory: 3,
        Faction: 123,
        Icon: "weapon.png",
        Id: 1000,
        ItemType: 4,
        Layout: "1020340303232311222000",
        Level: 400,
        Name: "Some weapon",
        PossibleModifications: [
                1,
                2,
                3,
                5
        ],
        WeaponId: 1001,
        WeaponSlotType: "L"
}
```
When reading from a file order of properties or fields doesn't matter.
When deserializing Adeptar ignores what would be a field or a property if it doesn't belong to the class or struct.

----------------------------------------------------------------

<h1>ID Feature</h1>
Index feature is used to serialize multiple objects into one.
For example in a file like this, there are 3 different objects serialized into one file. Each object that is appended to the file using the ID feature must
have a unique ID. The ID is used to find the necessary object. A file cant contain two objects with the same ID, if you try to serialize an object with an already existing ID, an exception will be thrown. The ID is taken as a string.

----------------------------------------------------------------
```cs
~odd_ints~
[1,3,5,7,9]
~even_ints~
[2,4,6,8,10]
~random~
[1,45,3,6,8,9,220,9]
```
